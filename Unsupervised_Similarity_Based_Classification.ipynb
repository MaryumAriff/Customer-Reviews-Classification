            "Review: I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Stylo Shoes, and I must say it was far from satisfactory. The customer service I encountered was nothing short of a nightmare. From unhelpful representatives to a lack of responsiveness, my interaction with Stylo Shoes has left me with a sour taste. When reaching out for assistance regarding a purchase issue, I encountered a disinterested and uncooperative customer service team. Instead of addressing my concerns promptly, they seemed indifferent to my problems, providing vague responses that left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a customer. This experience has made me to never shop from Stylo Shoes again. In a market saturated with options, the importance of exceptional customer service cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, Stylo Shoes falls short in this aspect, and as a result, they have lost a once-loyal customer.\n",

Did not even get the chance to pack it. Just put in a few things n noticed the bags sewing was coming undone n I was scared it will tear completely during the journey. Went to their zamazama branch to return. They said that it wud be returned but store policy says to go to place of purchase. When we got to ocean mall branch they said we cant return it. We told them that the people at zamazama said it cud be so they did it. The fact that they lied to us and sold us terrible quality items tho r a brand is very upsetting. Stay away!!\n",
