Trying Supervised Approaches
Preprocessing: Removing Nulls, Spaces, Incomplete Words
Taking 80-20 train-test split
Applying Bayes Classifier as our baseline
Evaluating using confusion matrix, accuracy,recall,precision,F1
Applying GloVe embeddings
Using Focal Loss
Using deep learning NN for classification - gives better results
Evaluating using confusion matrix, accuracy,recall,precision,F1
Trying Unsupervised Approaches
Preprocessing: Removing Nulls, Spaces, Incomplete Words
Used all_mini_L6_v2 for embeddings
positives and negatives both analyzed
Preprocessing: Null and extra spaces removed. Incomplete words are kept.
putting incorrect words into neutral and leaving them out
Gradio interface used
Trying RAG for classfication
