# Customer-Reviews-Classification

We used two Fashion Datasets for this project that included the Reviews of different customers at Stylo (a fashion company). The datasets, named ‘Google_Reviews’ and ‘NPS_Reviews’, are attached. We used both Supervised and Unsupervised approaches. The goal was to classify reviews as Actionable and Non-Actionable and then further classify the Actionable into different categories and identify the department that they should be forwarded to.

Following is the list of approaches we tried in each step of the overall project implementation:

1. Pre-processing:
    Removing Nulls
    Removing Spaces
    Removing incomplete words  
3. Embeddings
    GloVe
    Vader with mini-LM
    HuggingFace transformers
5. Evaluation
    For supervised: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
    For unsupervised: Visually analyzing the results
6. Supervised Classification
    Bayes
    Deep Learning NN
7. Unsupervised Classification
    RAG based
    Similarity based
